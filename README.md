# 1-WireDS18b20
Using ESPHOME and 1-wire to interface DS18B20 temperature sensors with Home Assistant
This was developed to use an ESP8266 and DS18B20 sensors but can be adapted to use any 1-wire compatible sensors.

All my sensors are connected together using the old 6 core telephone lines to do this at each end both striped and solid colours for each colour are joined together as this improved reliability and the esp8266 is connected in the garage where the oringal phone line connected so make sure to disconnect the phone line from outside if you use this method.


Ive also created holders for the sensors the designs are available to 3d print from my thingiverse.
